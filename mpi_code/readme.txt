put the folder mex_anz in your matlab path and use:

bru2analyze to convert the raw data (bruker 2dseq) to analyze

see help function of bru2analyze on how to use it.

the 2dseq files are in the: session_directory/scan number/pdata/n

where n usually equals 1 and represents the reconstruction number
rarely there will be a second reconstruction with different parameters
